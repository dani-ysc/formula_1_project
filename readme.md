# Project overview
I thought about this project for two main reasons: showcase my habilities in pyspark and pandas, and use my programming skills in a subject that I love, which is formula 1. This is a project in development.

# Project goals
1. Developing scripts that creates the tables needed for the pipeline using pyspark.
2. Developing the same scripts with pandas
3. Developing the base data engineering infrastructure of the AWS account using Terraform

Disclaimer: This project will be updated whenever I have time.
